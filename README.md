# madirohacks-hackathon-keyboard-warriors-frontend

This is our submission for the MadiroHacks 2022 Hackathon. We completed the open brief #3.

Globally, billions of people lack access to adequate healthcare. Whether due to isolation,conflict, or other barriers, every individual deserves access to essential health services.

Our goal was to design and build a digital solution to help increase health equity and accessibility on a global scale.

This mobile app enables doctors to treat patients living in rural communities, while managing their clinical practice all in one easy-to-use tool. It includes patient management functionalities such as a patient assessment logbook, medication documentation, vaccination records, appointment scheduling, and medical supply ordering.

It was an honour to create a digital solution designed to increase access to adequate healthcare on a global scale and to make an impact on people all over the world.
